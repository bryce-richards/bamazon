# Bamazon Store App

This App will allow all customers, as well as registered managers and executives, to access product data, make purchases, check stock, and inventory.


## Customer
Customers can view all of the products in the Bamazon database and, if they so choose to, purchase as many products as they'd like (if they're in stock).

If a requested product does not have the requisite inventory, they will be notified of how many units (if still available) are in stock, and given the option to continue with the purchasing process but for a different amount of units.


## Manager
Managers can login with their pre-registered username and password. If granted access, they have the option to:

### View Inventory
* This option will show managers all products as well as the current number of units in stock.

### View Low Inventory
* This option will show managers all products that have fewer than 5 units in stock.

### Add Inventory
* This option will allow managers to add more stock to existing products.

### Add New Product
* This option will allow managers to add an entirely new product, which will automatically be updated in the Bamazon database for future display


## Executive
Work In Progress...
